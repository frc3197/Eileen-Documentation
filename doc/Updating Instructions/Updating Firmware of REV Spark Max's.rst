Updating REV Spark Max Firmware
===============================
1. Download the latest Spark Max Firmware
2. Open up the REV SPARK MAX Client
3. While holding down the MODE Button on the Spark Max with a thin object such as a pen, pencil, or paperclip, connect the Spark Max to the computer using a USB-B to mini USB-C cable. DO NOT PLUG INTO CAN PORT OR YOU WILL FRY THE USB PORT ON THE COMPUTER.
4. Go to "Firmware" and click "Load Firmware."
5. Select the latest firmware. The imaging should take a few moments.
6. Go back to the "Basic" tab and set Idle Mode to "Brake." This is what we'll usually want. If the situation calls for it, we'll want the Idle Mode to be on "Coast" but this probably won't be needed.
7. The "CAN ID" Field lets us name the motor controller. Set to the number you want the motor controller to be. Usually corresponds to the number that electrical has already labelled the motor controller with.
8. The REV Spark Max is now properly imaged.
