Updating and Imaging the RoboRIO
================================

 1. Connect computer to RoboRIO using the USB-A (big square-ish end) to USB-B (normal USB end) cable.

 2. Open up the FRC roboRIO imaging tool. If the application cannot find the roboRIO, ensure that the USB is connected correctly and click rescan.

 3. Click on "Update Firmware," select the latest firmware, type in the team number (3197), and click "Update." This should take a little bit. If the process screws up, check the connection and retry.

 4. Click on "Format Target," select the latest image, type in the team number (3197), and click "Reformat." This should take a little bit. If the process screws up, check the connection and retry.

 5. The RoboRIO should be correctly updated and imaged.
